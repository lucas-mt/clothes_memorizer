# clothes_memorizer

I made this APP to help my mom in her online clothing shop she tried to run. unfortunally, this shop wasn't a success and we gave up on it.
But this APP is still very usefull if you're trying to save any kind of infos, as clothes or anything else you wanna save.

I intend to improve it I don't know when or what for.

This is the 2.0 version of this APP. the 1st version only worked on the command line.

I know this APP is a bit horrible and really, really insufficient, but the truth is: I don't know [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) yet. But when get I prepared i'll make a better version of it.

If you're gonna use this APP, for now, just remember to update the directory paths registered in the code, as they're from my own computer.

(sorry for my bad english!)
