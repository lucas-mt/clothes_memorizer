# clothes_memorizer

I made this APP to help my mom in her online clothing shop she tried to run. unfortunally, this shop wasn't a success and we gave up on it.
But this APP is still very usefull if you're trying to save any kind of infos, as clothes or anything else you wanna save.

I intend to improve it I don't know when or what for.

This is the 2.0 version of this APP. the 1st version only worked on the command line.

I know this APP is a bit horrible and really, really insufficient, but the truth is: I don't know [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) yet. But when I get prepared i'll make a better version of it.

this APP creates directories using the path (C:\Users\'your_user'\OneDrive\Documents). If this path is different on your computer for now, you should change it directly in the code.

(sorry for my bad english!)
